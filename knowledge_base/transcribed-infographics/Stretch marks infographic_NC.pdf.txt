WHAT ARE STRETCH
MARKS?

During pregnancy,

hormones can make the

elastic fibers weaker,

leading them to "snap" as

your belly grows.

WHEN DO THEY APPEAR?

-Typically around the second
trimester.

FACTORS THAT AFFECT
STRETCH MARKS:

-Hereditary/genetics
-The rate at which your belly
is growing

But again, depends on how much
weight you gain, how fast you gain it,

etc.

WAYS TO PREVENT THEM?

-Rubbing natural oil (coconut,
almond, etc.) can help moisturize
the skin.

-Staying hydrated helps keep the
elastic fibers flexible.

DO THEY GO AWAY?

The redness will fade after
delivery, and the marks
themselves can also become
less noticable over time.
