WHAT IS

THRUSH
IN NEWBORNS?

What is it?
e Thrush is a yeast infection inside your
child's mouth.
e Typically looks like white or yellow
patches on the tongue, roof of mouth,

gums, or cheeks.

How did it happen?

e The yeast infection most likely started in
your birth canal which is how it got passed
on to your baby.

e This is why it is most common in babies
under 2 months.

e If your baby is over 2 months, they may have
gotten it from taking antibiotics or from
unclean pacifiers/bottles.

Common Symptoms:

e White spots inside the mouth.
e Crying during feedings.

Treatment:

e An anti-fungal medication that can
be applied directly to your baby's
mouth may be prescribed.

If the infection spread into a diaper
rash or to your breasts, a different
medication may be prescribed
specifically for that area.

Future Tips:

e To prevent infections, clean

pacifiers, bottles, Dumps, etc.

e Wear cotton bras to allow moisture
to escape and wash them often.

e Ensure your breasts are dry after
feedings to prevent infections from

developing.
