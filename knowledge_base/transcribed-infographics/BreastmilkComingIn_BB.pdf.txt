The Three Breast
Milk Stages

Colostrum

It arrives day one postpartum. It is the first milk
produced and it is packed with antibodies and white
blood cells to protect baby from infection. It usually
has a gold-yellow color and it is very thick. It also
helps baby poop!

Your body actually starts producing colostrum early in
pregnancy. This must all be expressed before you can
pass transitional milk.

Transitional Milk

This milk comes in 3-4 days after birth.
There is more of it and it is whiter than
colostrum. It has a lot of calories for your
growing baby.

Signs of it coming in are breast
engorgement, leaking milk, tightened skin
on the breasts, higher milk supply.

Mature Milk

Mature milk comes in around 10-14 days
postpartum. This is the milk that you will
have until you stop breastfeeding. It is
thinner and whitish-blue. It has all of the
nutrients necessary for your baby to grow.
