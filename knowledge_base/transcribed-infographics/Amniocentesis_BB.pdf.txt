AMNIOCENTESIS

Amniocentesis is a diagnostic test that may be
recommended by your provider. It helps to
determine if certain genetic conditions are
present in one’s baby.

It detects chromosomal abnormalities, neural
tube defects, and genetic disorders. Down
syndrome is the most common chromosomal
abnormality. Cystic fibrosis and spina bifida
are other detectable conditions. It can also
provide access to DNA for paternity testing.

An ultrasound is used to guide a needle into
the amniotic sac to collect a fluid sample. The
procedure takes about 45 minutes total, but
the fluid collection takes about 5 minutes. The
fluid is then sent to a lab for analysis. Results
can take a couple of weeks.

It is performed between 14 and 20 weeks. It can
also be used later in the third trimester for
membrane rupture or uterine infections. It may
also help to determine lung maturity or treat
polyhydramnios.

This test is known for having a high level of
accuracy at about 98-99%. It is good for
detecting abnormalities, but it does not
determine how severe the birth defect is.

Contact your provider for any
questions or concerns!

It is rare to have any serious complicatio
from this procedure. Common side effects
feeling mild discomfort or cramping during
the procedure. Afterward, the provider may
advise resting for the remainder of the day.

Other possible complications include:
e Miscarriage (less than 1 in 200 women)
e Uterine infection
e Cramping, spotting, or leaking amniotic
fluid)
e Issues with Rh factor

Who is at higher risk of having
a baby with a birth defect?

e Women at age 35 or older

e Having a previous child or pregnancy with
a birth defect

e Family history of genetic conditions

e Abnormal prenatal screening tests

Testing allows certain opportunities for
patients:
e Pursuing possible interventions, such as
fetal surgery
e Advanced planning for a child with special
needs
e Time to adjust to the upcoming changes
e Finding resources early

Some people choose not to test for various
reasons:
e Religious reasons
e They are comfortable regardless of the
outcome
e The risks outweigh the benefits in the
parents’ eyes

The decision is an individual one, based on
what the parents believe is best.
