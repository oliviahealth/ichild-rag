Leaking Milk

WHAT TO KNOW

Is this normal?

Yes, this is acommon thing for breastfeeding moms.
It is temporary for some, and for others it lasts for the
duration of breastfeeding. They may leak or spray
when they are full. This is most common in the
morning or from the unused breast while feeding.

Why does this happen?

Your breasts may be overflowing because they are so full of milk.
Another reason they may be leaking is because of something called a
letdown reflex. This reflex tells your body to release a hormone that
makes your breasts eject milk. It can be triggered by hearing a baby
cry, smelling your baby, or thinking about your baby.

How long will it last?

Many women experience the issue
going away once they get into a
schedule with their baby. This takes
about 6-10 weeks. However, some
have it last for the entire duration of
breastfeeding.

Are there ways to manage this?

Nursing frequently can help to
prevent them from overflowing. You
could also try pumping the milk and
saving it in the fridge or freezer. If the
high pressure is not relieved, an
infection or clogging can occur.
