Inhibin-A: a protein made in the placenta and ovaries

What does it do?

It screens for certain genetic disorders. This
test differs from others because it has a
better chance of detecting a risk of Down
syndrome. It does not diagnose a problem.
It just determines whether or not more
testing should be done.

How is the test done?

Since it is a blood test, blood is drawn from the
mother and sent to a lab for testing. The blood
draw takes about 10 minutes, then results may

take a few days to come back. y
