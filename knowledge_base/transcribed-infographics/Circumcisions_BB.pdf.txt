What is a
circumcision?

There is a hood of skin
that covers the head of
the penis. This skin is
known as foreskin. A
circumcision is where
the foreskin is surgically
removed to expose the
end of the penis.

Risks

e Bleeding (usually a small
amount)

e Infection

e Scar tissue forming

Keep the area as clean as possible. Clean with warm
water and give your baby sponge baths until the area
is healed. Dress the incision with petroleum jelly when

changing the diaper for a couple of days.

Healing usually takes between 7-10 days. It is normal
for the site to be a little swollen and red with a small

amount of blood or a slight yellow crust.

Contact your provider with any concerns.
