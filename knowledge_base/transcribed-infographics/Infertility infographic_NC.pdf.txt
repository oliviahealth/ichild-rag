isk Factors for Infertility

According to The International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive
Technologies (ICMART):
Infertility is a disease characterized by the failure to establish a clinical pregnancy
after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse or due to an impairment of
a person's capacity to reproduce either as an individual or with his/her partner.

Being aware of some of the risk factors can allow you to make changes if needed!

Overall Health ~~

Factors such as:

e Having too much or too little body fat

e Diseases such as diabetes, lupus, arthritis, hyper
or hypothyroidism, hypertension, or asthma

e Abnormal pap smears

¢ Hormone imbalance
¢ Multiple miscarriages
e Alcohol consumption or smoking

Age

As age increases, risk for infertility
increases as well.

Talk to your healthcare provider if you are
over 30 and have been trying to conceive
for over 6 months.

Sexually Transmitted Diseases

e Use latex condoms
¢ Screen for and treat infections early
e Be aware that some STDs are asymptomatic

Fallopian Tube Diseases &
Endometriosis

e Early detection is vital

e It runs in families so be sure to let your
doctor know if there is any family
history of these diseases

Depression & Stress

Emotional factors like these can also
impact your hormones and therefore
your ability to conceive.

Approximately 44% of women with infertility
have sought medical assistance. Of those who
seek medical intervention, approximately 65%

give birth.
(Infertility As A Covered Benefit, William M.
Mercer, 1997)

Consider talking to your healthcare provider
about the possibility of infertility if you have
any of these risk factors along with problems
conceiving.

You can start by researching fertility
specialists near you.
