DEPRESSIONS
BABY BLUE

How to know the difference between

Postpartum Depression and Baby Blues
Both of which are more common than you may think.

Baby blues typically happen during the first 2
weeks following birth.

If the signs and symptoms last longer than 2
weeks, postpartum depression should then be

considered.

If the feelings of anxiety, sadness, mood
swings, etc. get severe, postpartum
depression should be considered regardless of

how much time has passed since birth.

Baby blues typically resolve on their own.

However, mothers experiencing postpartum

depression typically need treatment in order
to help them feel better.

ALWAYS CALL YOUR PROVIDER IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR IF YOU
HAVE THOUGHTS OF WANTING TO HARM YOU OR YOUR BABY.
