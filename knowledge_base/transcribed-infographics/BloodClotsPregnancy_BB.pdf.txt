BLOOD CLOTS IN

Pregnancy

WHAT IS A BLOOD CLOT?

A BLOOD CLOT IS A CLUMP OF BLOOD THAT FORMS TO HELP
STOP BLEEDING IN AN AREA OF THE BODY. WHEN IT BLOCKS
AN AREA FROM GETTING BLOOD AND OXYGEN, THEN IT CAN

BECOME A CONCERN.

WHO CAN GET BLOOD CLOTS?

ANYONE CAN GET A BLOOD CLOT, BUT PREGNANT WOMEN
AND THOSE WHO JUST GAVE BIRTH ARE AT A HIGHER RISK
OF DEVELOPING ONE. IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY OF

BLEEDING DISORDERS, MAKE SURE TO TELL YOU PROVIDER
THIS AT YOUR PRENATAL APPOINTMENTS.

WHY ARE PREGNANT WOMEN AT A HIGHER RISK?

PREGNANCY BRINGS CHANGES THAT INCREASE THE CHANCE
OF CLOTTING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE BODY NATURALLY CLOTS
MORE EASILY DURING PREGNANCY IN PREPARATION FOR A
HEMORRHAGE SITUATION. PREGNANCY CAN ALSO CAUSE A
WOMAN TO BECOME LESS ACTIVE THAN USUAL, WHICH
INCREASES RISKS AS WELL.

OTHER RISK FACTORS ARE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OBESITY,
SMOKING, IMMOBILITY, AND NOT DRINKING ENOUGH WATER.

COMPLICATIONS OF CLOTS DURING PREGNANCY

CLOTS CAN CAUSE HEART ATTACK, BLOOD CLOTS IN THE
PLACENTA, PREECLAMPSIA, PULMONARY EMBOLISM,
PREMATURE BIRTH, STROKE, AND MORE.

BECAUSE OF THESE RISKS, PREVENTION STEPS ARE VERY
IMPORTANT TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF CLOTS.

TIPS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF BLOOD CLOTS
STAY WELL HYDRATED
MOVE AROUND OFTEN! GO ON WALKS AND STRETCH
LEARN THE SIGNS OF A CLOT AND WATCH OUT FOR THEM
WEAR COMPRESSION STOCKINGS
