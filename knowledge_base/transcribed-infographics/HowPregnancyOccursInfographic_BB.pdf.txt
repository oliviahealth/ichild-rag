How Pregnancy
Occurs

It all starts with an egg and
Sperm cells

What are
sperm?

Sperm are microscopic cells that
are made and contained ina
male's testicles. Believe it or not,
millions of sperm cells are
released during ejaculation. It
only takes one sperm for

pregnancy to occur.

What are eggs?

Eggs are contained in the
female ovaries. The hormones
in awoman's menstrual cycle

causes eggs to mature each
month, making them available
for fertilization by a sperm cell.

Joining of Egg
and Sperm

If semen enters the
vagina, sperm cells can
move toward the fallopian
tube where an egg may

be. They can join together,
resulting in fertilization. If
an egg is fertilized , it will
move toward the uterus
and divide into more cells

Implantation
along the way.

Implantation occurs when the
ball of cells attaches to the lining
of the uterus. This is when
pregnancy officially begins. This
ball of cells begins to develop into
an embryo and a placenta. If the
egg implants, it will continue to
grow into a baby over the course

of about nine months.
