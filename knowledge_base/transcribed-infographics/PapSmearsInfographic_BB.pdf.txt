Pap smears look for cancers and pre-cancers in the cervix.

[Zâ€”
The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens into the

vagina. The cells that are looked for during the test can
potentially lead to cervical cancer. Most women ages 21-65

need to get Pap tests every couple of years.

HOW IMPORTANT ARE THEY?

Pap tests can be life-saving. Cervical cancer can be usually be
treated successfully if it is caught early. Most women 21-65 years
of age should get Pap smears routinely, even if they are not
sexually active or have gone through menopause. \Women should

get a Pap smear every 3 years.

ARE THEY PAINFUL?

Some women find Pap tests uncomfortable, but
they should not be painful. You will feel pressure
when the speculum is placed. lt may help fo use
the bathroom before the test and take an over-

the-counter pain medication.

DO I NEED TO PREPARE?

You do not have to prepare anything before your Pap test.
Make sure not to douche beforehand. Douching is never
recommended in any cases. Even if you are on your period, you

can still get your test. Though it is better to schedule it when

you are not on your period, it is better than missing it

altogether.

WHEN WILL I GET MY RESULTS?

You will usually get your results within 1-3 weeks. The results
will either be normal, unclear, or abnormal. Unclear means
that the doctor is not sure if the cells are normal or
abnormal. You may have to come back for another Pap test.
Abnormal means you may have to undergo additional tests

to determine if the cells are cancerous.
