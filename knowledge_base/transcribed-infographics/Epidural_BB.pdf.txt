How is it administered?

An anesthesiologist will administer the epidural.
They will ask you curl over while sitting on the edge
of the bed or while lying on your left side. This
curves your back into an optimal position for
administration. They will clean the area with an
antiseptic solution and a small area on the lower
back will be numbed with a medication. A needle
will then be inserted into the numbed area. A
catheter is then placed into the epidural space and
the needle is removed. The catheter can then be
used to provide medication. It should begin to go
into effect in about 20 minutes.

How long does it stay in effect?

Since a catheter is being used, a pump can
be set up to deliver epidural medication
continuously. This way, the woman can have
pain relief as long as it is needed. The
amount and strength can be adjusted
throughout labor as need.
