When you go into labor, your cervix will start
dilating, or opening up. It does this so baby
has room to come out. Your nurse or
provider can check how far dilated you are.

© Effacement: biel
Not only does the cervix widen, but it also

thins out, or effaces. This allows enough
flexibility to allow the baby to come out. This
can also be checked by a nurse or provider.

Contact your provider with any
questions or concerns.
