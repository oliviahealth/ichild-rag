MENSTRUAL CYCLE
FOR ADOLESCENTS

The menstrual cycle is more commonly known
as a period. This is something that starts near
the end of puberty. Read below for more
information about periods.

WHAT IS IT?

A period is when blood is released from the uterus and comes out of
the vagina. This happens due to hormonal changes in the body that
cause the lining of your uterus to thicken. It does this to prepare for a
fertilized egg that will turn into a baby. If a fertilized egg does not
attach, the lining will break down and bleeding will occur.

WHEN DOES IT HAPPEN?

The age at which a girl gets her period varies from person to person.
On average, girls tend to get their period around 12 years of age, but it
can happen anytime from age 10-15. It may not be regular at first, but
after a couple of years, you should have your period monthly. Periods
usually last around 5 days, but they can be shorter or longer.

DEALING WITH THE BLOOD

It may look like a lot of blood, but don’t be alarmed. It is usually
only a few tablespoons of blood lost during the entire menstrual
cycle. You can use pads, tampons, or menstrual cups. It’s okay to
experiment with each of these to see which one works best for you.

CONCERNS WITH PERIODS

Contact your provider if you are 15 and have not had
your period, still have irregular periods after 2 years,
have periods that last longer than 7 days, or have severe
cramps or very heavy bleeding.

You will have periods until you reach menopause, which
happens around age 45-55. At this time, periods will stop
forever. Periods also stop when a woman is pregnant.

If you have cramps, try using a heating pad on your
tummy and take some ibuprofen.
