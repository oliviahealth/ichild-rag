WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT

dow Libido

FOLLOWING PREGNANCY

YOU MAY GET THE GREEN LIGHT FROM YOUR PROVIDER TO
RESUME SEX ABOUT SIX WEEKS AFTER GIVING BIRTH, BUT
MAYBE YOU AREN'T FEELING UP TO IT. THAT IS COMPLETELY
NORMAL. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT MAY
CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR UNINTEREST IN HAVING SEX.

HAVING A BABY TO CARE FOR CAN BE EXHAUSTING. WAKING
UP MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGH THE NIGHT REALLY TAKES A
TOLL ON PARENTS. ITS NO WONDER YOU MAY NOT BE IN THE
MOOD. REST ASSURED THAT YOUR BABY WILL SOON START
SLEEPING MORE, ALLOWING YOU TO GAIN YOUR ENERGY BACK.

THERE ARE MANY HORMONAL SHIFTS THAT HAPPEN AFTER
YOU GIVE BIRTH, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE BREASTFEEDING. THIS
CAN LEAD TO VAGINAL DRYNESS, WHICH CAN MAKE SEX

WHETHER YOU HAD A VAGINAL DELIVERY OR A C-SECTION,
YOUR BODY IS IN RECOVERY. YOU MAY BE SORE OR
UNCOMFORTABLE, SO IT IS NATURAL TO NOT WANT TO JUMP
BACK IN STRAIGHT AWAY. TIME WILL HEAL YOUR BODY AND
ALLOW YOU TO BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE WITH RETURNING
TO YOUR PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES.

STRUGGLES ARE ALL EMOTIONAL BARRIERS THAT MAY BE
FACED AFTER CHILDBIRTH. THESE CAN CERTAINLY IMPACT A
WOMAN'S FEELINGS ABOUT HAVING SEX AGAIN. TALKING TO A
DOCTOR ABOUT THESE STRUGGLES AND HAVING A SUPPORT
SYSTEM IN PLACE WILL HELP YOU TO GET THROUGH THESE

LOW LIBIDO IS TEMPORARY. IT IS VERY
COMMON TO LAST FOR AT LEAST SIX WEEKS
AFTER PREGNANCY. FOLLOWING THAT, TIMES
VARY BASED ON EACH WOMAN. IT MAY ONLY
LAST SIX WEEKS, MAYBE A FEW MONTHS, OR
MAYBE EVEN OVER A YEAR. REST ASSURED

THAT IT WILL RETURN TO NORMAL
EVENTUALLY.
