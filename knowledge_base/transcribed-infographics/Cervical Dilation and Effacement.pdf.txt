Dilation and Ef facement

As you get closer to delivering your baby, your cervix will
dilate (open up) and efface (thin out) which allows the
baby to come out. Read below for more information on

dilation and effacement.

The cervix is usually closed up. As you get
closer to delivery, it will begin to open to make
a way for the baby. Your nurse or doctor will
measure this during labor. Once your cervix is
dilated 10 cm, it’s time to deliver the baby!

Women usually dilate in the ninth month of
pregnancy as they get close to their due
date. It may be a slow process for some
women while it happens quickly for others.

Effacement is the thinning of the cervix. This
also has to occur in order for the baby to pass
through the opening. When you are 100%
effaced, it’s time to deliver the baby!

Dilation and effacement both need to take
place in order for the baby to be born. It
helps to create a big enough opening for the
baby to pass through.

Not really! Your body is pretty much in charge here.
It may take some time, so be patient. If necessary,
your healthcare provider can take some measures
to induce labor, but in the meantime, sit back and
let your body do its thing!

If you have any questions or concerns,
contact your healthcare provider!

They will be able to help with anything you are worried about.
