WHAT CAUSES BABY ACNE?

e Maternal hormones still in the
bloodstream can stimulate the baby's
oil-producing glands, which leads to
acne on the baby's face, neck, back, or
chest.

e Additionally, since the baby's pores
aren't developed completely, they are
at a higher risk for dirt to get inside
them.

e Babies also have very sensitive skin.

TIPS TO GET RID OF IT:

e Leave the pimples alone (no
squeezing, picking, etc.).

e Clean the area with warm water and
pat the skin dry.

¢ Don't use soap or lotion.

¢ Don't use adult skin products on
your child.

e Use natural remedies instead, such
as using breast milk to dab on the
area.

e Ask your doctor for baby-safe

prescriptions if needed.
