ALL ABOUT THE
PLACENTA

PLACENTA ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

WHAT iS iT?

The placenta is a temporary organ that develops during
pregnancy. Its role is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to
your baby through its umbilical cord. It also removes
waste from your baby. Additionally, it produces some
hormones necessary during pregnancy.

WHERE iS iT?

It is in your uterus throughout the entire
pregnancy. It is very close to your baby. It
attaches to the wall of the uterus. The position
of the uterus will vary from person to person.

WHERE DOES iT Go
AFTER BIRTH?

After your baby is born, the placenta needs to be
birthed as well. This is a much easier process than the
childbirth. In a vaginal birth, it just requires a couple of

extra pushes. In a C-section, the provider will remoue it.

WHAT HAPPENS To iT?

It is up to you to decide what you would Like to do with
your placenta! You are able to take it home if you talk to
your provider. Some cultures have rituals that they
perform with their placenta, such as burying it. You can do
some research on uses for a placenta. If you donâ€™t wish to
take it, the hospital can dispose of it for you.

COMPLICATIONS

There are some complications that can occur related to the
placenta. Some examples include a retained placenta, the
placenta blocking the cervix, and the placenta embedding too
deep into the uterus. Be aware of these, but do not worry
unless your provider presents a concern to you after viewing
it in an ultrasound at your prenatal appointments.
