HER
IMMUNI

Herd immunity is when many people in the population
are immune to a disease, making them unlikely to spread
the disease to those who are not immune. This indirectly
protects those that are not immune because they are
less likely to come into contact with someone who is
infected and contagious.

Herd immunity often occurs through vaccinations. A lot
of the diseases that children get vaccinated for today
were once widespread. Thanks to these immunizations,
society has established herd immunity against them. Now
these diseases are much rarer. Herd immunity can also
occur if many people become infected and build up
immune defense against future infections.

Some parents feel that the herd immunity is strong
enough to protect their unvaccinated child, but this is
not always the case. In any instance where one of these
diseases is introduced into the population, unvaccinated
children are at high risk of contracting the disease. Herd
immunity on its own is not a completely reliable way for
your child to be protected.

Many of the diseases that are vaccinated for still exist, like
the flu. Vaccinations help to protect your child.

Vaccinating your child helps protect those who cannot
get vaccinated, like those who are immunodeficient,
pregnant, or have cancer.

Herd immunity only works when a large majority of people
are vaccinated.

Vaccinations help to protect
children and they save lives!

concerns, contact your healthcare
provider.
