After you are fully dilated
and effaced, you will have
very intense contractions.
You will feel an urge to
push. This stage may last

30 minutes to a few hours.

Following delivery of your
baby and the placenta, all
there is left for your body to
do is recover! Ask your
provider what can help with
recovery and take it easy.

This is when your body begins
preparing for birth. It includes
early, active, and transitional
labor. Your cervix will dilate
and efface. Your contractions
will become more frequent
and regular. This is the Longest
stage. It may Last anywhere
from 2-24 hours. It depends on
each person.

After your baby is
delivered, the placenta
must still be delivered.

Your body will use gentle

contractions to facilitate

this. It will take about 20
minutes.

After all of that hard
work you go through,
you deserve to go home
and focus on recovering
and enjoying your new
baby!
