CAN YOU GET PREGNANT
ON YOUR PERIOD?

It is not likely that you will get pregnant
if you have sex while on your period.
This is because ovulation, which is the
time that a woman is most likely to
conceive, is several days after your
period. This applies to women who

have the typical 28-30 day cycle.

The exception is women who have a
shorter cycle, around 21-24 days.
These women can ovulate soon
after their period, and since sperm
can live inside you for up to 5 days,
there is a chance that you could
become pregnant.

What about right after your period?

Right after your period, you are approaching your
fertility window. Again, sperm can live up to 5 days. If
you have sex right after your period, there is a chance
that you could become pregnant. Your chances of
conceiving increases with every day after your period
has ended.

What about right before your period?

The chance of getting pregnant right before your
period is very low. If you have a normal cycle, you will
likely ovulate sometime between day II and day 21. An
egg is only available for 12-24 hours to be fertilized.
This means that the days right before your period are
the safest time to have sex without getting pregnant.

Women's ovulation cycles vary, so chances
can be different for everyone. If you are
trying to conceive, the best chances are in
the later days of your cycle. If you are not
trying to conceive, the earlier days are safer,
but you should also use another form of birth
control, like condoms or a pill.
