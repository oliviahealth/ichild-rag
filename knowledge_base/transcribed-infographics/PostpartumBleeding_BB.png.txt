Postpartum
Bleeding

Postpartum bleeding is also known as lochia. It is a normal part
of recovery after childbirth. Read below for more information on
postpartum bleeding and how to manage it.

What is lochia?

Lochia is the vaginal bleeding that occurs after delivery. It
consists of blood and mucus. It is normal and natural. It |
will occur whether you had a vaginal birth or a C-section. |
The body is just shedding all of the extra material that

was needed during pregnancy. The bleeding is heavier

than a menstrual period. It will be heaviest about 3-10 4
days after delivery, then it will begin to taper off.
