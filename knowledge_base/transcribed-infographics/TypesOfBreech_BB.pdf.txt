TYPES OF BREECH
PRESENTATIONS

As birth approaches, a baby usually moves into a position
where their head will come out first during birth. This is a
vertex presentation. A breech presentation is when the baby’s
bottom or feet are positioned to come out first. There are
many types of breech presentation, which are shown below.

Complete Breech

In this position, the baby’s
bottom is pointing down with the
legs folded at the knees and the

feet near the baby’s bottom.

In this position, one or both of
the baby’s feet are pointed down.
This will be the first part of the
body to deliver during birth.

Incomplete Breech

This position is very similar to
complete breech, but only one of
the legs is folded at the knee.
The other one is usually sticking
up toward the face.

In this position, the baby’s
bottom is pointing down with the
legs sticking straight up in front
of their face. Their feet will be
positioned near the head.

Contact your provider with any
questions or concerns.
