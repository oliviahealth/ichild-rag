Once you start seeing signs that it is time to start potty training, you might be
very excited, but may not know where to start. Try to have patience
throughout the process, as your toddler is learning something new. This video
will include different tips and strategies that might work for your child.

Remember that all children are different! It will be more
frustrating for everyone involved if a child is pushed to learn

before they are ready. Do not fret if they are a taking a little
longer than you expect them to.

Preparing your kid for
potty training

Make the bathroom positive and fun!

This will provide encouragement and make them want to
continue doing well

Dress your toddler in clothes that are convenient for potty
training, like stretchy pants rather than one pieces or clothes
with buttons or zippers

Have them practice pulling down and pulling up their pants
Demonstrate using the potty for your toddler - seeing it can help
them to learn

Pick the right the potty! Perhaps one with a comfy seat or foot
rests - this will make the experience as comfortable as possible

How to Potty Train

+ Switch to Pull-Ups to help bridge the gap

Watch them closely for signs that they need to go, then
guide them to their potty

Keep your child motivated with encouraging words and
maybe a treat, like stickers

Teach them to check for dryness, and if dry, give them
positive reinforcement, but don't get angry if they are wet
Be patient and don't nag - thins can discourage them
Don't ration fluids to decrease the need to pee

The most important thing is to be
patient and have fun!
Good luck!
