POSTPARTUM
NUTRITIONS, Ce

Your body just took on a huge task - housing
and birthing a baby. Of course, your body is
going to need some good nourishment after
pregnancy. Read below for more information
about postpartum nutrition.

There are a couple of reasons why good
postpartum nutrition is important:

e It provides nutrients for your
breastfeeding baby

e It increases breast milk production

e It promotes recovery from birth

e It is good for your body

Good types of food to focus on in the postpartum
period would be fruits, veggies, lean proteins (like
chicken and fish,) whole grains, and healthy fats (like
cheese and yogurt.) These foods will provide you with
a lot of wonderful vitamins and minerals that will
benefit you and a breastfed baby.

It is also important to stay well
hydrated. If breastfeeding, it is best to
avoid alcohol. On the bright side, you can

go back to eating deli meat, sushi, and
other foods that may not have been
recommended during pregnancy!

A lot of the necessary vitamins and minerals can
come from a healthy, well-balanced diet. Some
women are told by their doctor to continue
taking their prenatal vitamins after birth to get
some of those levels up. Talk to your doctor to
see if this is a good option for you.

Breastfeeding moms burn around 400 extra &

calories per day, so keep that in mind when
planning meals. You want to make sure to
eat enough to keep your energy levels up. 2 p

Try to drink about IO cups of water each
day to ensure that you stay hydrated.
