WHAT IS IT?

Skin-to-skin contact is
the act of parents
holding their infant, who
is only in a diaper, on
their bare chest as often
as possible. It can be
done by either moms or
dads.

HOW TO PRACTICE
SKIN-TO-SKIN

Skin-to-skin is beneficial at any time during infancy,
but the first 2 hours after birth are the most
important.

Sit in a quiet, private room. Place your diapered baby
on your bare chest for twenty minutes or more. This
can be done by moms or dads. You can cover up
with a blanket, as long as baby’s skin is in direct
contact with their parent's skin.

You can experiment to see what works best for you
and baby. Do it as long as it in enjoyable for
everyone involved. If baby starts getting fussy, it’s
alright to stop skin-to-skin.
