Fetal Non-Stress —
Test (NST)

What is it?

This is a simple, non-invasive test
that is done in pregnancies over 28
weeks. It looks at the heart rate
and movements of a baby. Healthy
babies will have an increased heart
rate when moving and the heart

rate will decrease at rest.

How is it done?

One monitor will measure the baby’s
heart rate and one will measure
contractions. Movement and heart rate
are measured for about 20 minutes. If
the baby isn’t moving, it does not
necessarily mean there is an issue. They
could just be asleep. The nurse will try
to wake the baby and repeat the test.

When is it done?

An NST may be done if:

¢ Mom thinks the baby is not moving as much as usual
¢ Mom is overdue
e It is a high risk pregnancy

It can help to show if baby is recieving enough oxygen. If
they are not, it may be due to umbilical cord or placenta
issues.

Risks and Side Effects

Because it is non-invasive, there are
no known risks or side effects for mom

or baby.
