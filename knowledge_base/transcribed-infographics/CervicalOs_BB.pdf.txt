ALL ABOUT THE

CERVICAL OS
INPREGNANCY

What is it?

The cervical os is the lower end of the
uterus. Is is almost like a narrow tube
that connects the uterus to the vagina.

What does it do?

It helps to keep the baby in the uterus until it
is time for birth. It also contains the mucus
plug, which acts as a barrier between your

baby and the outside.

Internal and External
Cervical Os

There are two openings to the cervix. The
internal os opens into the uterus while the
external os opens into the vagina.

Changes During Birth

During labor, the cervix begins to soften, thin, and
shorten. This is called dilation and effacement. It does
this to allow baby to be delivered. Your cervix will be

checked periodically by the nurse or provider to

determine when it is time to push.

Changes After Birth

The cervix will usually return to its original
size within six weeks of delivery.
Fortunately, this tissue is meant to stretch,
so it bounces back relatively quickly.

Contact your provider with
questions or concerns.
