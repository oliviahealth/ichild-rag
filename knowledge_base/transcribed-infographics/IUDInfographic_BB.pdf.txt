INTRAUTERINE DEVICE (IUD)
A FORM OF BIRTH CONTROL

What is an IUD?

IUD stands for Intrauterine Device, as it is a device

that sits in the uterus. It is a small, flexible piece of

plastic shaped like a T. An IUD is placed in the

uterus to prevent pregnancy. It is one of the most
effective birth control methods available. It is a long 0)
term form of birth control and it is reversible.

Types of IUDs

There are five different brands of I|UDs that
are FDA approved in the U.S. These are
divided into two types: hormonal and copper.

Hormonal IUDs use the hormone progestin to
prevent pregnancy.
Copper IUDs do not use hormones.

How do these prevent pregnancy?

Copper IUDs use copper to prevent pregnancy.
Sperm do not like copper, so the Paragard IUD
is very effective in preventing sperm from

reaching the egg. Hormonal IUDs work by
thickening cervical mucus to block the sperm

from traveling to the egg, and also by S
preventing eggs from leaving the ovaries. /
How effective are IUDs?

UDs are one of the most effective birth
control methods available. They are more
than 99% effective. Since there is no need
to remember to take a pill every day or
change a ring every couple of weeks,
there is little room for mistake.
