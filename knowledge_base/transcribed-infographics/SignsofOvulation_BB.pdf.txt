S\GNS AND SYMPTOMS of

Ovulation

Ovulation is the time when your body is most fertile. This is when
you are most likely to get pregnant. You may choose to track your
ovulation to increase your chances of getting pregnant.

Ovulation usually
occurs about halfway
through your
menstrual cycle.
During this time, there
is an egg available for
fertilization for about
12-24 hours.

If you are trying to get
pregnant, you may
choose to keep track
of this time. There are
some symptoms that
happen during
ovulation that may
clue you into your
bodyâ€™s fertility.

Changes in Cervical Mucus

You may notice your
cervical mucus become
thin, slippery, and more
clear than it is at other

times of the month. Some
say it resembles egg
whites.

Pain and Tenderness

During ovulation, you may feel
a slight cramping sensation in

your lower abdomen.

You might also have
tenderness in your breasts
due to the hormones.

Increased Body Temperature

Your basal body temperature
increases ever so slightly during
ovulation. You are most fertile the
day before your body temperature
increases, so this method can be
used over a few months to
determine what time of the month
you are most fertile.

Increased Libido and Mood

You may have an increased sex
drive in the days leading up to
ovulation. This is due to the
hormones produced during this
time.

You may experience an
increased mood during
ovulation as well.

Bloating & Swelling

The hormones
involved in ovulation
may cause some
bloating in your
body. It can also
cause slight swelling
of your labia.

You may experience
some nausea and
headaches as well.

Some people have
heightened senses
during ovulation,
like an increased
sense of smell.
