The baby will be delivered by C-section and the uterus will be repaired.

This is not common, but if the damage is too great, a hysterectomy might
be needed. Either way, things should be taken easily following surgery.
Be careful getting up, get lots of rest, eat healthy foods, and drink plenty
of water.
