BIRTH
CONTROL

Hormonal methods include
changing the hormone
levels in the body to
decrease the chance of
pregnancy, like the pill or
patch.

Temporary birth
control means
that if they
were stopped
at any time,
pregnancy is
likely to occur.

After having a child,
some people are ina
position where they
are seeking birth
control methods.

Whatever the reason
may be, there are
options out there for
parents.

Sterilization is
more than 99%
effective. It is
not reversible,
so a parent
should be 100%
sure about this
decision.

Barrier methods, such as
condoms, are widely
available at most grocery
and convenience stores.

Hormonal birth control is a
little harder to access, as it
requires a prescription
from your primary care

provider.
