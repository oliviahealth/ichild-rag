How can | tell if I'm in labor or not?
You can ask yourself a couple questions to figure out if it is real or false labor.

How frequent are the contractions? True labor has a regualar pattern, with
contractions that get closer together. False labor has irregular contractions.
Use a timer to figure out how frequent your contractions are. Record how long
they last as well.

Does activity change the contractions? True labor has contractions that last
no matter what. If you try drinking water, walking, taking a bath, or changing
position and the contractions go away, then it is likely false labor.
