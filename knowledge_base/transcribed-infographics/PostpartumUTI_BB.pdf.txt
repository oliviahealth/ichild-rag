POSTPARTUM URINARY
TRACT INFECTIONS

What is a postpartum urinary
tract infection (UTI)?

A UTlis an infection of the urinary tract. They can affect
the bladder, urethra, and kidney. They are caused by
bacteria entering the urinary tract, often a result of a

urinary catheter placed during delivery. They will manifest
within a few days after giving birth.

Symptoms of a Postpartum UTI

It can be a little tricky to distinguish between a
postpartum UTI and regular postpartum pain with
urination. Urination may be painful after a vaginal birth
becuase of the pressure that was put on your bladder.
Additionally, teraing can cause stinging when you pee. The
same can occur in women who had a cesarean birth
because of the catheter placement during the procedure.

Symptoms of a UTI include:

e Pain/burning while peeing

Feeling like you need to pee often, though not much
comes out

Foul-smelling or cloudy urine

Fever, chills, malaise

Pain in the bladder area

Blood in the urine

Nausea and vomiting

Treatment for a Postpartum UTI

Mild UTIs can easily be treated with some at-home
antibiotics. Taking the full course of antibiotics while also
ensuring that you are drinking plenty of fluids will help you
get rid of your infection! If you are breastfeeding, do not
fret! Many antibiotics are safe for breastfeeding and your
doctor will help you find the best medication for you.

back after using the bathroom -
