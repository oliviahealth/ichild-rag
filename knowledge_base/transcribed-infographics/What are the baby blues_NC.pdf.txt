Feelings of sadness that can last up
to two weeks after birth.

Baby blues can be caused by the change in
hormones occurring after birth. Lack of
sleep or food can also contribute, as well as
all of the emotional changes giving birth
and having a baby brings.

e Tearful, crying for no reason
e Mood changes

e Anxious, sad, restless

e Hard to concentrate

Your partner can also experience the baby
blues due to stress, hormone changes,
relationship difficulties, etc.

Symptoms such as pulling away, focusing on
work more, or feeling overwhelmed can
occur during baby blues.

Call your provider if:
e Symptoms last longer than 2 weeks
e Symptoms escalate and get more
severe
e You have thoughts of harming yourself
or your baby
