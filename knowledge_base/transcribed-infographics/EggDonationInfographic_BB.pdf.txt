EGG DONATION +.

What is egg donation?

Egg donation is when a woman (donor) gives her eggs to another

woman to allow them to have a baby. The donor is given medication

that allows them to develop many eggs in one cycle, since usually

only one is produced. The eggs are then gently removed from the

ovaries and evaluated. In vitro fertilization is then able to take

place, where sperm from a male partner or sperm bank is placed

around or in each egg. - . )
