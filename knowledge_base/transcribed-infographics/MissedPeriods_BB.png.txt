Missed or
Late Periods

A missed period is known as one of the
biggest signs of pregnancy. If you usually
get your period at the same time each
month, your mind may immediately jump to
pregnancy if you are late to get your period.
There are many factors that can affect your

menstrual cycle. Read below for more

information on these factors.

Hormonal Birth Control
Birth control contains hormones that affect
ovulation and menstruation. When you
first start hormonal birth control, it is not
uncommon to have changes in your
period. It may be late for a couple of
months before it starts to regulate.

Weight
Being underweight or experiencing
extreme weight loss can affect your body's
hormone production, which affects your
menstrual cycle.

On the other hand, being overweight or
having extreme weight gain will also
impact your menstrual cycle. Your periods:
may become heavier or more irregular. In
some instances, they may be completely

â€œ oe missed.
Stress or Illness
Extreme emotional stress or the stress of an illness, like
the flu, can impact your body in many negative ways. It oD

causes changes in hormone levels and this can result

ina late or missed period.

Excessive Exercise

Over-exercising is another thing
that can cause changes in your

red

hormone levels. This is even more

likely if you are over-exercising
and restricting what you eat.

Medications
In addition to birth
control, other
medications can cause a
late or missed period.
Some of these include
corticosteroids,
antidepressants, and
antipsychotics. Talk to
your doctor about your
medication if you are
concerned.

Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding causes
hormone changes that
can cause you to miss
your period or have lighter
ones. This is due to the
increase in prolactin, a
hormone that increases
breast milk production
but decreases
menstruation.

Thyroid Issue
The thyroid is responsible for metabolism,
so if there is an issue with it, periods may
be less frequent. Depending on the thyroid
issue, periods can either be heavier or
lighter.

Changes in Sleep
Whether you switched to working the night
shift or you are experiencing jet lag from a
recent trip, sleep changes will impact your
menstrual cycle. Any of these will throw off
your body's natural clock which can cause
a missed or late period. Try regulating
your sleep schedule to get this issue in
check.

altogether.
