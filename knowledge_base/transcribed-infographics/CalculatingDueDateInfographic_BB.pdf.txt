Calculating Your

Due Date

An estimated due date is when you are
expected to give birth! It is a great @
guide to use when preparing for baby, \
but remember that it is only an -
estimation. It is rare for babies to arrive
exactly on their due date.

Using Your Period

Typically, pregnancies are expected to
last 40 weeks, so you can simply count
AO weeks (280 days) from the first day of
your last menstrual period. This is the
most typical way for healthcare
providers to calculate the due date.

Using Your IVF Transfer Date

Embryo transfers usually occur three or five 7
dates after the egg is retrieved and @
fertilized. If you had a three day transfer,

count 263 days from the transfer date to

calculate your due date. If you had a five

day transfer, count 261 days.

Your due date can change for a number of reasons. It
may be due to irregular periods and new discoveries
in later ultrasounds, or because of other reasons.

If you have any concerns, contact your doctor. They
will be able to answer questions that you may have.
