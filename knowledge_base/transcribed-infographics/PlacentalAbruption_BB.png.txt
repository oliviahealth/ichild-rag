PLACENTAL
ABRUPTION

What is it?

Placental abruption is an uncommon complication of \
pregnancy. The placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus and \ ‘
provifdes the baby with oxygen and nutrients. In an abruption,

the placenta dettaches from the uterus before the baby is

born. It can be a partial or a complete separation. If this

occurs, the baby won't recieve enough oxygen and nutrients

Since it separates from the uterus, it can cause a lot of pain

and bleeding for mom.

This occurs in 1% of people. If an abruption occurs, it usually
happens in the third trimester, but it can happen at any time
after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
