What to Expect at the

Hospital for a Stillbirth

|

If you know that your baby has died
before it’s time to go to the hospital,
you will most likely have to make a
few decisions:
¢ Induction vs Keeping the baby in
your womb for 2 more weeks
¢ Natural birth vs C-section

¢ A few tests will be done on your
baby, and afterwards, you can
choose to spend time alone with
your baby.

A few things you may do during this
period of time:

¢ Keep a lock of your baby’s hair

¢ Get imprints of your baby’s
footprints
Get measurements of your baby
Give your baby a bath and dress
your baby
Take pictures with your baby
Anything that would help you
process this difficult experience

¢ Your body will need to heal from
giving birth.

Your breasts may still fill with
milk, which will go away after a
few days, but expect that they
may be sore.

Leaving the hospital:

e Returning home without your
baby is an extremely difficult
thing to do.

¢ Having someone else move your
baby’s stuff to another room
until you are ready to go
through it may help.
