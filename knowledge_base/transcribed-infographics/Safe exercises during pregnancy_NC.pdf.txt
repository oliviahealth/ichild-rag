SAFE
EXERCISES

TO TRY DURING
PREGNANCY

Walking

Involves all of your muscles
and joints, leading to a full
body workout.

Yoga

You can find designated yoga

classes for pregnant women!
Yoga can help with stress,
stretching, and breathing.

Swimming

This is a great exercise to
prevent injury since the
water will help support the
weight on your joints.

Stationary Bicycling
The unequal weight of your
belly may make normal
biking dangerous, but using
a stationary bike is a great
way to get the same
workout in!
