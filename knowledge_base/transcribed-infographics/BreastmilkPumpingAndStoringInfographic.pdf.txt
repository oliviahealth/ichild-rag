Pumping and Storing

You May Want To Pump
and Store Your

may find it difficult to
leave your baby without
worrying about them
getting fed. If you are
leaving for work or a quick
trip, you'll want to have
breastmilk stored and

available.

If you are away from
your baby, it would be
helpful to pump during

the times that your baby
would normally eat so
that your body continues
making milk. Wash your
hands thoroughly and
make sure your pump
parts are clean.
