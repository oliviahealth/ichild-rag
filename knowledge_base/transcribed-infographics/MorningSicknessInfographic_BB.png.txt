Morning sickness is the nausea that many women
experience during early pregnancy. It can occur

at any time of day, but it seems to stop after
about 12 weeks of pregnancy. It is not harmful,
but if you are unable to keep food down for along
period of time, you may lack essential nutrients
and electrolytes. If this happens to you, consult
your doctor for ways to treat it.
