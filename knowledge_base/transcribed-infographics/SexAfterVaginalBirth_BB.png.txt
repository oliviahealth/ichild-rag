SEX AFTER s®
A VAGINAL 2”

BIRTH

It can be hard to figure out when your body can return to its
pre-pregnancy activities. Read below for more information on
returning to sex after a vaginal birth.

WHEN CAN I HAVE SEX AGAIN
AFTER A VAGINAL BIRTH?

Typically, women are advised to wait 4 to 6 weeks to resume sex after giving
birth vaginally. With that being said, you need to also consider how your
body is feeling even after this time frame has passed. If you are up for it and
aren’t experiencing pain or bleeding, go for it! If you had complications
during your birth, you may need a little more time to heal

If it has been 6 weeks and you just don’t feel like it, that’s okay too! Your
body is recovering from a big event, so listen to it and do what is best for
you. This is a temporary thing, so just give yourself more time to return to
your previous level of activity.
