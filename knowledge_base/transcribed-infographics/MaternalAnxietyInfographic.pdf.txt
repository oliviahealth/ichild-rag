Maternal Anxiety

Recognition & Prevention

.Â¢

You've probably heard of postpartum depression, but
what about postpartum anxiety? It is real, but not
talked about very much. How much worrying is too
much worrying?

What is maternal anxiety?

Maternal anxiety occurs during and after pregnancy. It is described
as excessive worrying, racing thoughts, bad feelings, and dread.
Some worry is natural, but it should not be severe and it should
eventually go away. It becomes a problem when they do not go
away, are irrational, and interfere with daily life.

Does this only present after the baby is born?

Not necessarily, it can occur during pregnancy as well. This may
present as excessiv worry throughout the pregnancy. You may ask
yourself, "is my baby's heart beating? Is my baby healthy?" Feeling
them kick or move around does not ease the worry.

Is this different from postpartum depression?

They are different, but commonly go hand-in-hand. Women are at
higher risk of developing maternal anxiety if they have dealt with
anxiety in the past. These feels can also be caused by hormones, a
history of depression, and a history of miscarriage or infant loss.

Ways to cope with maternal anxiety
Maternal anxiety presents in up to 20% of women. A spouse can
also experience parental anxiety even if they did not birth the baby.

Ways to cope include therapy, meditation, exercise, healthy
distractions, and medication from a provider.
