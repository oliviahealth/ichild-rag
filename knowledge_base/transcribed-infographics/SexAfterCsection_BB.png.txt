SEX AFTER A

C-SECTION

It can be hard to figure out when your body can return to its
pre-pregnancy activities. Read below for more information on
returning to sex after a C-section.

WHEN CAN I HAVE SEX AGAIN
AFTER A C-SECTION?

Typically, women are advised to wait 4 to 6 weeks to resume sex after having
a C-section. As long as you are up for it after that time frame, and you aren’t
bleeding or having pain and other issues, go for it! If you had complications
during the delivery, your body may need a bit more of a break.

If it has been 6 weeks and you just don’t feel like it, that’s okay too! Your
body is recovering from a big event, so listen to it and do what is best for
you. This is a temporary thing, so just give yourself more time to return to
your previous level of activity.

RISKS OF SEX AFTER A C-SECTION

If your body is not completely healed before resuming
sex, there is a chance of bleeding or infection. The way
to avoid this is by monitoring your incision and making
sure it is healed before having sex again. Listen to your
body if you are having any pain. Ask your provider for
advice if you are concerned at all.
