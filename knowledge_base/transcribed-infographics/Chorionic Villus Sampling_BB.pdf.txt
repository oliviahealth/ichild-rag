What To Know About

CHORIONIC VILLUS
SAMPLING

WHAT IS CHORIONIC VILLUS SAMPLING?

It is a prenatal test that is used
to diagnose some birth defects
or abnormalities in your baby.
The provider will take a tissue
sample from the placenta and
use it to check the baby’s health.

WHEN IS THIS TEST DONE?

This test can be done very
early in pregnancy, around
10-13 weeks. This test is
not done on all women, as
there is a very small é
chance of miscarriage :
after the CVS test.

WHAT ARE REASONS FOR HAVING THIS TEST?

This procedure should be discussed between you and your
provider. A CVS may be recommended if you are at risk for having
a baby with a genetic abnormality.

You may be at risk if:

¢ You are 35 or older
e You hada previous child/pregnancy with a birth defect
e Family history of a genetic disorder

HOW IS THE TEST DONE?

The procedure usually takes about
30-45 minutes. There are two kinds.
One is done through the belly
(transabdominal) and the other is
done through the cervix
(transcervical). The tissue is then sent
to a lab to be tested. Results usually
take about 1-2 weeks.


SIDE EFFECTS AND RISKS

Some women report feeling a cramping sensation when
the sample is taken. Others say that it is painless. You
may experience cramping for a few hours after the test.

Other risks include miscarriage (reported in 1% of
women), Rh sensitization (where mom and baby’s blood
mix), and infection. An injection may be needed if Rh
sensitization occurs.

CONTACT YOUR PROVIDER IF

You experience

Contractions

Heavy bleeding

Fluid leaking from the vagina
e Fever

AFTER THE TEST

The results may take a couple of weeks, but in most cases, they
show that the baby is healthy. If the results show that the baby
does have a birth defect, your provider will be able to share your
options going forward. This may include surgery or medications.

Knowing about your baby’s condition ahead of time may allow
you and your family to prepare. This could help you to give your
baby the best care possible when they arrive.

UNSURE ABOUT HAVING THE TEST?

The decision about having this
test is definitely a personal
one. Consult with your provider
and other healthcare
professionals to weigh the risks
and benefits. They will help to
determine what the best
decision is for you and your
baby. Ask them about the
procedure as well as other
procedures and options.
