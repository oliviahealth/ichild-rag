ECTOPIC
PREGNANCY

What is it?

Instead of a fertilized egg implanting in
the uterus like a normal pregnancy, in an
ectopic pregnancy, the egg implants
somewhere other than the uterus. Most
often, they implant in the fallopian tubes.
Other spots include the ovary, abdomen,
and cervix. None of these places are
sufficient enough for a fetus to grow.

Why is it dangerous?

Since these areas are not sufficient for fetal

growth, the fetus can burst the organ that it is
contained in as it gets bigger. This can lead to
severe bleeding and can endanger the mom's life.

Signs and Symptoms

This can be hard to diagnose because symptoms
are similar to early pregnancy: missed periods,
nausea and vomiting, tiredness, and frequent
urination. The first warning signs are often pain or
vaginal bleeding. There may also be low blood
pressure due to blood loss, dizziness/fainting, and
lower back pain.

What causes it?

Usually an ectopic pregnancy is due to a fallopian tube
getting blocked. This can be caused by: pelvic
inflammatory disease endometriosis scar tissue from
previous surgery

Diagnosis and Treatment

An ultrasound can be used to detect a suspected
ectopic pregnancy. There are a couple of different
treatment methods, like a methotrexate injection or
surgery. Contact your healthcare provider to determine
the best option for you.

Call your doctor if you are are pregnant and having pain,
bleeding, or other symptoms of ectopic pregnancy.
