BREECH BIRTHS:
WHAT TO KNOW

bottom or feet are positioned to come out first
during birth. The ideal positioning, vertical
presentation, is when the baby's head is set to
deliver first.

Different Types

and the knees and feet near the baby's bottom

e Frank breech: the bottom is aimed at the birth canal with the legs
sticking straight up with the feet near the head

e Footling breech: the feet are pointing downward and will be
delivered first

Possible Causes

Can it be changed? “

There are some methods that can be used for
turning a baby from the breech position into the ty
vertical position. It is recommended that you talk

to your health care provider to see which method

she recommends.

Can I still do a vaginal delivery?

It is usually not recommended that a vaginal delivery be attempted for a
breech position. Since the baby's head is the last part of the body to be
delivered, it is a more difficult delivery. Additionally, the cord could be
squeezed during delivery, which impairs the delivery of oxygen and blood.
Cesarean delivery is usually the recommended method.
