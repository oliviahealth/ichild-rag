THERE ARE SOME DOWNSIDES TO BLW

It is messy, as your child will be grabbing foods with their
hands and learning how to get it to their mouths. You will
also need to pay attention to the foods they are eating to
ensure adequate amounts of vitamins.

HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR BLW.

Keep the foods soft or easily dissolved, cut it so it's easy to
grasp, eat with your baby, give them the same foods you are
eating, offer a variety of foods, continue to nurse or bottle-feed.

OF COURSE, YOU MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT CHOKING

Avoid hazard foods like whole grapes and large chunks
of food, always supervise, keep them sitting up, look for
allergic reactions, and take an infant CPR class.

TAKE IT SLOW AND HAVE FUN WITH IT!

Research the best foods for BLW to find soft and

dissolvable foods. As they get older, they will be more
ready for harder, chewable foods.
