EPISIOTOMIES

ADVANTAGES AND
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS

WHAT IS AN EPISIOTOMY?

An episiotomy is a procedure where a small cut is
made to widen the vaginal opening when a woman is
giving birth. It can help to avoid skin tearing and aid
in the delivery of their baby.

WHEN IS AN EPISIOTOMY NEEDED?

e When the baby’s head is too big for the vaginal opening

e When birth is fast and the area has not had time to stretch
e When the baby is in distress

e When forceps or vacuum-assisted delivery is needed

e When the mother is unable to control pushes

« There may be other instances where one is needed

HOW IS AN EPISIOTOMY DONE?

An epidural or a local anesthetic called a pudendal block is what
is used to prevent the woman from feeling pain. The provider
then places a cut angled down, away from the vagina.

CAN THE NEED FOR AN
EPISIOTOMY BE PREVENTED?

Perineal massage before or during the second
stage of labor can help to stretch the muscle. This
will decrease the chance of a tear or the need of an
episiotomy. Using warm compresses may also help
to prevent tearing. Good nutrition, kegels, and
controlled pushing can help as well.

SIDE EFFECTS OF EPISIOTOMIES

Side effects may include infection, brusing, bleeding,
longer healing time, scarring, and swelling.

RECOVERING FROM AN EPISIOTOMY

An episiotomy will likely complicate the healing process following
vaginal birth. The area may take longer to heal. There are some
things that can be used to ease discomfort.

e Witch hazel pads e Lay on your side
