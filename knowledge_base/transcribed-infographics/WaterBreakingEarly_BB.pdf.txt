WATER BREAKING
EARLY IN PREGNANCY

WHEN YOUR WATER BREAKS EARLY IN
PREGNANCY, IT IS KNOWN AS PREMATURE
RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES (PROM). SOME

COMPLICATIONS CAN ARISE FROM PROM,
SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

MORE ABOUT PROM

Premature rupture of membranes is when a pregnant
woman's water breaks before 37 weeks of pregnancy. The
body may not be ready to go into labor, putting the mom and
baby at risk for complications such as infection, a prolapsed
cord, and premature delivery of the baby.

AMNIOTIC SAC

Babies are contained in an
amniotic sac filled with amniotic
fluid within the uterus. When this
sac breaks, people often call it
their “water breaking.” Typically,
the water breaks when labor is
about to begin. The sac has
many purposes, such as
protecting the baby from
infection and helping their lungs
develop.

MANAGEMENT

If PROM occurs, the
amniotic sac cannot be
closed again. You will have
to stay in the hospital so
you and baby can be
closely monitored. You may
be given some medications
to help your baby continue
to develop. Tests will be run
as well. There is a chance
that you could go into labor
early, but your provider will
assist you in figuring out
what the best plan is for
you and your baby.

SIGNS OF PROM

You will notice fluid leaking
from your vagina if your
water breaks. It can be a
large gush at once, or it
could be a slow trickle. It

should be clear, light
yellow, or pink. If it has a
foul odor and is greenish-
brown or red, you should
seek medical attention
immediately. If your water
breaks early, you should
contact your provider.

CAUSES OF PROM

Sometimes the
membranes rupture
spontaneously, with no
apparent cause.

There is a higher risk if an
amniocentesis is
performed, there is an
infection in the amniotic
sac, or if the pregnancy
includes more than one
baby.

Contact your provider with any questions or concerns.
