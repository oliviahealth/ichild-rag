How the Body Changes
During Pregnancy

Some bodily changes are obvious, but some are more
subtle. Nearly every body system goes through
changes, let's take a look at how!

Endocrine and Circulatory

Throughout pregnancy, your body will become flooded with
hormones which may result in moodiness, exhaustion,
nausea, and hot flashes.

There will also be an increase in the amount of blood in your
body to support your baby. This can lead to increased risk of
varicose veins, dizziness, frequent urination, and an elevated
heart rate.

Digestive and Musculoskeletal

As your baby grows, more pressure will be put on the
stomach and intestines, leading to changes in digestion.
You could have constipation, acid reflux, and slowed
digestion.

Additionally, your spine will realign to maintain balance
and your posture and gait may change in response. It is
not uncommon to have back pain as well.

Respiratory

You will need a larger amount of oxygen for the
growth of your baby. As a result, you may
experience increased respiratory rate, shortness
of breath, and an increased amount of rest
needed when exercising.

Breasts and Abdomen

Breasts may increase in size, become tender, nipples
may stick out, and colostrum may leak from the breasts
in the third trimester.

The abdomen will greatly expandduring the second
and third trimester. This can cause abdomen aching
adn stretch marks.

Other Changes

Other changes may include leg cramps, blurred vision,
sciatica, changes in hair and nail growth, swollen feet and
ankles, and a slight increase in body temperature.

On average, a woman will gain 25-35 pounds throughout
her pregnancy to support her growing baby.
