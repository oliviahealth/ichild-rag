TIPS FOR A NEW MOM WHO
IS GOING BACK TO WORK

When preparing to go back to work,
consider talking to your boss about
your situation. Let them know that you
will be adjusting to returning from
maternity leave and having a new
baby. They may be able to offer some |
flexibility, whether that is a part-time
job, different hours, or simply easing
back into your full-time job.

When going back to work, planning and organization will be
your best friend. If you are breastfeeding and want to continue
breastfeeding, pump ahead of time and build up your frozen
milk supply. Begin introducing a bottle to your baby a couple of
weeks before returning to work. You can also pump at work!

. To-Do Time management is
ee another vital skill to have in
this time. Use to-do lists to
plan out what you want to
accomplish for the day, and
prioritize the big things!

Transitioning back to work after
maternity leave is going to be an
adjustment regardless if you are excited
to go back to work or not. Allow
yourself to feel all of your feelings. The
beginning can be overwhelming, but it
will get better with time.

Figure out a childcare plan for your
baby, then have a backup in place as
well! Things happen, so itâ€™s good to
have a plan B. Ask your family and
friends if they may be able to help!

Again, transitioning back to work can
be a stressful time. You will be
working AND caring for your baby,
but it is still very important for you to
make time for yourself. Take a
bath, go for a walk, grab a coffee, or
whatever helps you relax!
